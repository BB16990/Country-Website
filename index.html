       <p>
         Greenland was Founded on May 1st, 1979, meaning it is only 44 years old. The population of Greenland is 56,643. Even though Greenlandic today is the official language, major tensions between the mother language and Danish remain. The political and administrative elites predominately speak Danish while 70 percent of the population speaks only Greenlandic.
